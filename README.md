# acisam_homepage

This is a webpage designed and programmed by me, Paul Eibensteiner in 2018. Texts and images are property of ACISAM.

## To-Do, some day, maybe

1. Gallery: For now I can't figure out how to implement a gallery as a custom editor component in netlifycms (cause of nested list widget), so this will have to wait.

2. Better Font Control: I guess you would've to build react components for paragraph toggles, like the ones that are used for the markdown stuff.

3. Legacy support. This page is only tested in modern browsers, absolutely no attention to older browsers.

4. Better SEO: Well, I guess quality content and proper backlinks would do their magic, but there is definitely not everything done about code optimisation either.

## Whoever would like to comment is welcome

Thx to the creators of hugo, netlifycms and github ;)
